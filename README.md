# Calorie-Tracker

I wanted to create a tracking application similiar to My Fitness Pal that soley focused on tracking calories, since that is the most common method of weight loss for most individuals. 

I used Bootstrap (included in the head of my html) and implemented axios using get request by fetching nutritional information from an external API (Calorie Ninjas API) when a meal is entered (included in JS).

By entering the name of the meal, the amount of calors and ingredients, the meal is logged for the day and total calories are calculated as more meals are entered.
